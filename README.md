The Car Price Analysis and Prediction project focuses on analyzing historical car market data to identify the key factors that influence vehicle prices and to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its features. This project demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning-based price prediction.

The goal of this project is to help buyers, sellers, and automotive businesses make data-driven decisions by understanding how attributes such as brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine specifications impact car prices.
